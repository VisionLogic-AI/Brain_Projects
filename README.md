# Brain_Projects
This repository consists of brain projects as it relates to the field of deep artificial intelligence.
As you know, the brain is a very complex organism that has yet to be solved. It's my belief that we as a human soecies are still a long way from solving the complete "brain mapping' problem within the field of neuroscience.

I do however believe that we have made tons of progressive within specific areas in the field of neuroscience and AI.
In this repository, you will find host a projects that are related to the brain.

The focus has been on using EEG, MRI and fMRI data in order to get a better understanding of the brain, it's activity and how we can use the power of AI to solve some of the worlds toughest problems as it relates to the brain.
